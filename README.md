# Remote Feelings: Haptic feedback for hand based control of distant robots

Team: Adam Curtis, Aymeric Wang, Xinying Hu

EECS 249A Embedded Systems Project Charter, Fall, 2021

# CODEBASE
https://github.com/BerkeleyCurtis/ESP32_firmware_eecs249
Set up platformio on vscode and use this repo as your code base. 

# NOTICE
12/26/2021 - The second version of the PCB is nearly finished. I'm working out a sponsorship deal with PCBway, and will hopefully get great prices through them. Look for a link here in the next couple weeks. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jwyhd0EK1jnIPco-h1I057X4X2TIgmSV?usp=sharing

CAD models will be uploaded later. There are many dependency issues I created as I iterated through changes, and I need to clean up the models before I can share something useful. The STL files should be pretty good, but depending on your printer, you might need the models to adjust hole sizes, tolerances, etc. 

# Goal
Allow a person to interact more intimately with a remote object or an object in VR and simulation. 

# Motivation
Increase feedback response for doctors, technicians, and other hands-on professionals to work remotely via robotic arms and grippers, or train in simulation with the tactile feedback needed to perform these tasks.

# Build your own! 
I have started the process of writing detailed instructions on everything from setting the tollerances for your 3D printer, to board bring-up and testing, to upgrading a servo motor for direct control of the motor.
