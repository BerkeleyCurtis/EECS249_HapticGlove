Team: Adam Curtis, Aymeric Wang, Xinying Hu
EECS 249A Embedded Systems Project Charter, Fall, 2021

# Goal
Allow a person to interact more intimately with a remote object or an object in VR and simulation. 

# Motivation
Increase feedback response for doctors, technicians, and other hands-on professionals to work remotely via robotic arms and grippers, or train in simulation with the tactile feedback needed to perform these tasks.
